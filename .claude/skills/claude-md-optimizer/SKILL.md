# CLAUDE.md Optimizer

Optimize CLAUDE.md files by applying the discoverability filter: remove information agents can discover from code, keep only non-discoverable operational knowledge (gotchas, landmines, non-standard conventions), and mine source code for undocumented gotchas.

Research shows redundant context (directory trees, data flow diagrams) degrades agent performance by 15-20%, while human-authored operational knowledge reduces runtime by ~28%.

## Flag Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for optional flags:

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--dry-run` | Analyze and show diff without modifying the file |
| `--report-only` | Output statistics and classification table only |
| `--path <path>` | Target CLAUDE.md path (default: `./CLAUDE.md`) |
| `--help` | Display usage and exit |

If `--help` is present, display available flags and a brief description of the 4-step workflow, then stop.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Baseline Analysis

Read the target CLAUDE.md. Collect line statistics:

```bash
node .claude/skills/claude-md-optimizer/scripts/line-count.mjs '<TARGET_PATH>'
```

Classify each `##`/`###` section into one of three categories:

| Category | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `discoverable` | Agent can find this via Glob/Grep/Read within 10 seconds | Remove |
| `operational` | Non-discoverable, operationally significant | Keep |
| `verbose` | Operational knowledge but overly detailed | Compress |

To classify, **actually read the source files** referenced in each section. Verify whether the information is truly discoverable. Detailed classification criteria are in [`references/methodology.md`](references/methodology.md).

Present results as a table:

```
## Baseline Analysis — <filename>

Total: XXX lines (YY sections)

| Section | Lines | Category | Rationale |
|---------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Directory Structure | 63 | discoverable | Glob **/* reveals this instantly |
| Design Rules | 8 | operational | Non-standard constraints, not in code |
| Config & State | 24 | verbose | Operational but compressible to ~6 lines |

Removal candidates: XX lines (XX%)
```

If `--report-only`, stop here.

### Step 2: Gotcha Mining

Scan project source code to find non-obvious operational knowledge missing from CLAUDE.md. Use the systematic checklist in [`references/gotcha-mining.md`](references/gotcha-mining.md).

Key Grep patterns to run on the codebase:

```
MUST|WARNING|HACK|TODO|FIXME          → developer-flagged gotchas
catch.*exit\(0\)|process\.exit        → error exit policies
setTimeout|setInterval|deadline       → timing constraints
=== null|== null|delete result        → implicit semantics
process\.platform|/proc/version       → platform detection quirks
cooldown|throttle|lastNotified        → rate limiting scope
```

Present findings:

```
## Discovered Gotchas

| # | Category | Description | Source | Already in CLAUDE.md? |
|---|----------|-------------|--------|-----------------------|
| 1 | Timing | 5s→4s→2s budget | _common.mjs:21,52 | No → Add |
| 2 | Implicit | null = key deletion | config.mjs:157 | No → Add |
```

### Step 3: Generate Optimized CLAUDE.md

Use AskUserQuestion to confirm before modifying:

> Based on the analysis:
> - **Remove**: X lines of discoverable content (Y sections)
> - **Compress**: X lines → ~Y lines (Z sections)
> - **Add**: X new gotcha items
>
> Options:
> 1. **Apply all** — Remove discoverable, compress verbose, add gotchas
> 2. **Item by item** — Review each change individually
> 3. **Cancel** — No changes

Apply the selected changes using Edit (prefer surgical edits over full rewrite).

If `--dry-run`, show the diff but do not write.

**Structure for optimized CLAUDE.md** (recommended section order):
1. Project description (1-2 lines)
2. Development Commands
3. Design Rules (non-negotiable constraints)
4. Gotchas & Landmines (categorized subsections)
5. Conventions (non-standard project patterns)
6. Version/Release Management
7. Testing

Detailed anti-pattern examples with before/after are in [`references/anti-patterns.md`](references/anti-patterns.md).

### Step 4: Verification

Re-run statistics and present before/after comparison:

```bash
node .claude/skills/claude-md-optimizer/scripts/line-count.mjs '<TARGET_PATH>'
```

```
## Optimization Results

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Total lines | 182 | 90 | -51% |
| Discoverable lines | 80 | 0 | Removed |
| Operational lines | 60 | 55 | Kept |
| Gotcha items | 0 | 25 | Added |

Discoverability filter: all remaining lines pass "not discoverable from code" check.
```
